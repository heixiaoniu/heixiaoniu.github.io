## Research Experience

- Oct 2023 - Present: **Visit at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen**<br>
  Responsibilities: **Emotional text-to-speech**<br>
  Under the guidance of Professor Haizhou Li, I am conducting research on emotional speech synthesis using large speech models. This involves creating emotional conversational speech datasets and ultimately serving conversational text-to-speech systems.<br>
  (Shenzhen, China)<br>

- Dec 2022 - Aug 2023: **Research on Streaming Any-to-Any Voice Conversion**<br>
  Responsibilities: **Streaming voice conversion**<br>
  To address the research gap in streaming speech conversion in arbitrary scenarios, I introduce a novel model called RTTL-VC. This innovative approach helps transfer comprehensive content knowledge from text-to-speech to voice conversion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RTTL-VC excels in terms of both latency and conversion quality, rendering it highly suitable for real-time applications.<br>

- Dec 2022 - Apr 2023: **Project on *Joint Extraction Technology of Entities and Relationships for the Financial***<br>
  Responsibilities: **Model training and system development**<br>
  In collaboration with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, I actively contributed to a project focused on joint extraction of financial text internship relationships at the chapter level. My primary responsibilities included assisting senior colleagues in model training and actively participating in the development of the project acceptance system.<br>
  (Shanghai, China)<br>

- Oct 2018 - Apr 2020: **National College Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program**<br>
  Responsibilities: **System development**<br>
  The research topic is *Building a Multi-dimensional Course knowledge Graph Framework Based on Deep Learning*. Specifically, I am responsible for the application development, and assist other members to construct the knowledge graph.<br>
  (Wuhan, China)<br>

- Jul 2018 - Aug 2020: **The Revision and Reconstruction of *Introduction to Computer System***<br>
  Responsibilities: **Front-end development and system maintenance**<br>
  The *Introduction to Computer System* is a course teaching website. It was revised using the React and React Native frameworks in the early stage, and reconstructed using the Ant Design Pro framework based on React in the later stage. I am mainly responsible for front-end development and post-maintenance.<br>
  (Wuhan, China)<br>

- Mar 2019 - Jun 2019: **The 12th Chinese Collegiate Computing Competition**<br>
  Responsibilities: **Front-end development, data analysis and related competition preparation**<br>
  On the basis of the introductory system, the evaluation of students' learning ability is added, and the structural equation model is used to evaluate the learning ability of the student data collected by the system with the help of AMOS, and is displayed in the system in the form of a radar chart. The improved system Participate in computer design competitions.<br>
  (Wuhan, China)<br>

- Jul 2019 - Aug 2019: **2019 ICDM/ICBK Knowledge Graph Contest**<br>
  Responsibilities: **Front-end development**<br>
  With the help of senior students, we took part in a competition about knowledge graph. We worked together to move to the next stage, where we turned our knowledge graph into a useful app. I led the development of the whole app using React + Laravel and we won an honor award (Top 5).<br>
